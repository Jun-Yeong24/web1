<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  A style sheet that pre-states the overall style of a web document.
  It can maintain consistency throughout the document and reduces the need for detailed styling details.
  Traditional HTML has many limitations in designing and changing web documents from time to time.
  To complement this, style sheets are designed and the standard for style sheets is CSS.
